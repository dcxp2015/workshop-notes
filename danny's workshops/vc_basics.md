## Version Control Basics
Here you'll find a workshop on the basics of using version control for everyday projects, tailored towards Git.
#### Key Takeaway
Version Control is important (read: necessary) for any sort of project you write with more than one developer, and incredibly useful for independent projects as well. So long as you commit early and commit often, you'll never run into issues of code loss and will be able to easily share, document, and revert any project changes.
#### What is Version Control?
Version Control is a means by which a project's history and revisions are stored for later access. All of this information is stored in what's called a *repository*. This repository can live either on a local machine or online somewhere. Services that allow for the creation of these repositories include, but are not limited to, [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [SVN](https://subversion.apache.org). Applications such as [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) make these repositories come alive by providing a network to host and share these repositories, both privately and publicly. We'll be using GitHub for our projects here in DCxP, so this workshop will focus on the effective use of GitHub and Git for team projects.
