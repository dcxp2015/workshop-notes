##Web API Development
Typically, when an application needs to use data stored in some sort of online database, for example, a user's scores for a game, the application won't access the database directly. Allowing direct database access from all client-side devices poses a huge security risk and can become incredibly burdensome on the developer. For this reason, most applications use some sort of Web API that can be accessed directly from the application and provides application-specific database manipulation. This workshop will provide some tips for API development, with a primary focus on PHP. 
##Key Takeaways
I cannot stress enough how important it is to think long and hard about how you design your API. With any API that handles sensitive data, security should always be top priority. Remember that no matter how hidden you think your API might be, so long as your application calls to it, there is always a way for someone to mimic those calls and manipulate them for benign or malicious purposes. Also remember that PHP is not your only option for API development. It is just one of the most widely used, and most widely disliked. In fact, there is an entire [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp) dedicated dislikable things about PHP. Other options include, but are not limited to Python (Django), Ruby, Java, and Javascript (NodeJS).
