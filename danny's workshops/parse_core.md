##Notes On Parse Core
You've seen how much work goes into implementing database services for applications, even simple ones. As it turns out, it is possible to develop an online data-storing application (mobile, web, computer, etc) without the need to craft a web service or API. Services such as [Parse Core](https://www.parse.com/products/core) (currently owned by Facebook) exist for the very purpose of taking all the API development hassle out of this kind of development. This workshop talks about the advantages and disadvantages of developing your application using Parse Core.
####Key Takeaway
Parse Core is great because it's easy to use, portable, secure, and fast. Parse also provides integration with Facebook, Mobile Push Notifications, application usage analytics, and more. That being said, it is not entirely clear what occurs on the backend. All of the real magic occurs on the mysterious Cloud, which may be foreign or unsettling to a traditional system admin. Also, Parse throttles usage based upon how much money you pay for their services. The basic application is free, but supporting larger applications could cost hundreds to thousands of dollars per month.
